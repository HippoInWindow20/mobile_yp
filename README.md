# Mobile YP. 行動延平

An app aiming to create an intuitive experience for browsing information from YanPing servers.  
This app aims to integrate all of the services most commonly used in the website, only less clutter.  

# Why I'm doing this

1. The website layout is GOOBAGE
2. The website isn't very user friendly
3. The colour palette hurts my fucking eyes
4. School project hehe
5. A timely solution to reading information in an era when everybody has a phone (人手一機)
